          It is company policy that we receive the original auto part back
          before sending you a replacement auto part. The original auto part
          must be returned using the provided shipping label. The shipping cost
          for both the original and the replacement auto part is a cost
          attributed to the shipper at hand. Note, if these auto parts are not
          shipped back to the supplier within 30 days of the delivery date of
          the replacement part, the buyer's credit card is subject to a recharge
          for the initial cost of the original auto part (minus the initial
          shipping cost) If you have any questions about the shipping back of
          the original part, please contact your personal sales representative
          or the customer service team at (888) 338-9066. Press 2 for "Returns */}
