          Most of our orders are processed for shipment or delivery (leave our
          warehouse) within 24-48 hours after the customer confirms the order
          (the Image of the part sent by us) unless otherwise specified.
          Delivery or transit times can vary depending upon the size of the
          package and the delivery location. Generally, packages are delivered
          within eight (8) to nine (9) business days (excluding weekends and
          holidays) from the date package(s) leave our warehouse.{" "}

          We recommend that as soon as you receive your order, kindly go over or
          inspect all the shipping part(s) or package(s) and items thoroughly
          for any signs of damage, missing, or incorrect parts. Our warehouses
          endeavor all the efforts they can to prevent the damage during
          shipping, but it does occur at the juncture. If you happen to receive
          a damaged part or incorrect part, please do call us immediately to
          prevent you from being charged freight both ways. Do not send/return
          the part(s) or package(s) before receiving an RMA (Return Merchandise
          Authorizations). All the warranty provided by us (Prime Auto Parts Pro) for
          any damaged, incorrect parts will be void after 7 business days,
          regardless of which party is at fault. We are not answerable for lost
          or stolen packages, and all claims for such incidents must be reported
          and processed through the shipping company.{" "}

        <strong>Risk of Loss</strong>
        <p>
          {" "}
          All the items purchased from our website are made in consonance with
          our shipping or delivery terms, which are FOB shipping points. This
          indicates that the risk of loss, title and responsibility of any goods
          is passed from the seller to the buyer at the shipping point, which is
          when the carrier accepts the goods for transport. Even though we are
          not directly responsible for any lost or stolen packages, but we will
          be happy to assist you with a further claim with the shipping company.
          You must contact us immediately if the entire shipment was not
          received within two (2) full days of the carrier’s estimated delivery
          date. All requests must be made within seven (7) days of the shipment
          date for any possibility of a claim. Do not send/return the part(s) or
          package(s) before receiving an RMA (Return Merchandise
          Authorizations).{" "}
